## Summary

Hi, I&#x27;m Jet! My passion is teaching today&#x27;s software developers to write secure code as part of modern DevOps pipelines, at speed, and at scale, without missing a beat. I know how to build AppSec programs using all of the SAST, DAST, and SCA flavors of the week for finding, exploiting, and fixing bugs in code, especially the OWASP Top 10. I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for over 20 years and believe that fix security bugs is better than just finding them. I believe that a perfect AppSec program includes first training, then testing.

 I&#x27;m, a creative problem solver with a wealth of experience managing people, processes, and technology. I&#x27;m a skilled communicator who deftly translates the verbose into the succinct.I put the needs of the team above my own, finding that when I clearly communicate vision, support my team, and get out of the way the swell of other &#x27;s success carries me forward.

 In my free time I like to ultralight backpack, mix cocktails from homemade extracts, and hack all.the.things.

### Application Security Architect, [Cambia Health Solutions](http://www.cambiahealth.com)
##### 2016-05-13 - 2017-11-02

* When I started at Cambia there was no formal AppSec program. In addition to conducting initial assessment using Qualys, BurpSuite and Checkmarx I pioneered the adoption of a more robust automated testing suite utilizing both SourceClear for open source software composition analysis as well as Veracode for both static analysis and dynamic analysis. I engaged dozens of app teams to assess their applications on an ongoing basis including manual testing, and had 88% of teams doing continuous security by the time I left. The average scan frequency across all apps was 7.6 scans per month.
* Set up the company&#x27;s first ever Capture the Flag event, demonstrating attack techniques to developer using BurpSuite, Postman, and NMAP to attack the OWASP Juice Shop.
* Created a Secure Code Champions program to teach software developers, managers, and architects elements of a comprehensive application security program.
* Spoke at 5 conferences/events since I started on topics from &#x27;AppSec Zero to Hero&#x27; - how to create a program, launch it, and keep it running; to &#x27;What&#x27;s hiding in your app?&#x27; - a review of the open source dangers lurking in today&#x27;s applications
* Conducted regular penetrations tests of web applications across the enterprise using BurpSuite, Postman, &amp; NMAP scripts to verify mitigation of results from Veracode scans third-party pentests as well as known vulnerabilities from open source findings.

Cambia Health Solutions is a group of more than 25 health care companies and includes software and mobile applications, health insurance, non-traditional health care marketplaces and delivery models, pharmacy benefit management, wellness solutions and more. I was brought on to bootstrap an Application Security program, introducing automated analysis built into the software development pipeline, training programs to turn developers into secure code champions, and policies &amp; procedures to tie it all together, all in months rather than years.

### Security Solutions Architect, [Veracode, Inc.](http://www.veracode.com)
##### 2015-11-16 - 2016-04-16

## Awards

### Oh SNAP! There&#x27;s Crap In Your App from RSA Conference, 2018 on 2018-04-18

Today’s developers download awesome libraries for their favorite language to do almost anything. We scan our code for flaws with static analysis tools, but what about all the stuff we didn’t write? Learn how to find and track the crap in your app, and how to avoid getting pwned because you let a nasty in the back door with that library that does the really cool thing you couldn’t live without.

### Securing Your Code from Zero to Hero from Jenkins World, 2017 on 2017-08-30

With a shift to the cloud, our software needed to be bullet-proof against security defects in a fast-paced DevOps model. The problem: how to build in security along the entire pipeline, keep developers focused on writing great code, and do it all with speed and at scale.

### Application security: From zero to hero from O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Convention, 2017 on 2017-05-10

Application security is tough. But while the rest of the world tries to solve the problems of insecure software with firewalls and intrusion detection, Jeremy Anderson explains how to solve the problem where it starts: at the code that defines it. Join Jeremy to learn how to fix code security defects when they’re created instead of during production when it’s already too late.
